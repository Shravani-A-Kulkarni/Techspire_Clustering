# TechSpire Clustering

TechSpire Clustering: A project for clustering datasets using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project demonstrates clustering techniques on a dataset to identify patterns and group similar data points.
It includes data preprocessing, model training, and storing trained models for future predictions.

## Folder Structure

- `data/` : Contains cleaned datasets used for clustering.
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks with EDA, model training, and results.
- `models/` : Trained clustering models saved for reuse.
- `README.md` : Project documentation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Implementation of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN).
- Visualization of clustered data.
- Export of trained models for reuse.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Shravani-A-Kulkarni/TechSpireClustering.git
   cd TechSpire_Clustering

2. Install required packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in `notebooks/` folder using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run the cells sequentially to see data preprocessing, clustering, and visualizations.
3. Models will be saved in `models/` folder after training.
